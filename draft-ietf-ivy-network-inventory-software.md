--- abstract

This document extends the base Network Inventory YANG model to support
 non-physical network elements (NEs), such as controllers, virtual
 routers, and virtual firewalls, as well as software components
 like platform operating systems and software modules. In addition to
 the software revisions and patches already defined in the base model,
 this extension introduces software status and time stamp information.

# Introduction

The Network Inventory consists of the physical and non-physical
      network elements (NEs), hardware components, firmware components, and
      software components on a managed network domain. The non-physical
      network elements (NEs) are network devices that support network
      protocols and functions, e.g., routers, firewalls, and controllers,
      which can reside in any network or compute devices, such as servers in
      Data Center (DC), server-based virtual machines (VMs), or server-based
      containers.

 {{!I-D.ietf-ivy-network-inventory-yang}}  defines the base
      Network Inventory YANG model for physical network element (NE) and
      hardware components of NEs. Examples of hardware components could be
      rack, shelf, slot, board and physical port.

The management of non-physical NE and software components information
      is similar to the management of physical NE and hardware information.
      For example, inventory data, including product names, serial numbers,
      etc. are also applicable. This document defines a network inventory
      software extension YANG model. In addition to inheriting the common
      inventory attributes of the base network inventory model, this document
      also adds some software-specific attributes of non-physical NEs (such as
      controllers, virtual routers, and virtual firewalls) and software
      components (such as operating system, software modules, BIOS, and boot
      loader).

The Network Inventory software extension model is classified as a
      network model (Section 4 of  {{?RFC8309}}).

The YANG data model in this document conforms to the Network
Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) defined in {{!RFC8342}}.

# Relationship to Other YANG Data Models

The base network inventory model supports the software versions of
      NEs and software versions of hardware components. This document adds
      more software component identifiers (e.g., platformos, software patch)
      and more NE types (e.g., software NE, virtual NE) to provide enhanced
      software information on the NE to facilitate software compatibility
      check.

{{fig-ni-sw-mod-relation}} depicts the relationship between
      the Software Extension model and the base network inventory model. The Software Extension
      network inventory model enhances the model defined in the base network
      inventory model with more software specific attributes.

# Model Overview

The tree diagram in {{full-tree}} provides an overview of the data model for "ietf-network-inventory-sw-ext"
      module.

The model applies software extension attributes at two levels:
   *  NE-level "software-rev": Describes the main system software
      revision of the network element, such as the network
      operating system release of the whole device.
   *  Component-level "software-rev": Describes the independent software
      or firmware revision of an individual component, such as a line
      card software, a line card firmware, or a pluggable software module.

# Non-physical Network Elements

In the base Network Inventory YANG model, "ne-type" is a YANG
      identity that describes the type of the network element and only the
      "physical-network-element" identity" is defined. This document adds
      non-physical NE identity, such as "ne-software", "ne-virtual", and
      "ne-container".

The base Network Inventory model also defines common inventory
      attributes, including the software version, patch versions, product
      name, and serial number. The data is also applicable to non-physical
      NEs.

The Network Inventory software extension mode defines some new
      software attributes, consisting of software status, installation time,
      and activation time.

# Software Components

Software components refer to the software installed on the NE, such
      as operating system, software modules, BIOS, and boot loaders.

Similar to the common inventory attributes of NEs, the common
      attributes of software components (such as software revisions, patch
      revisions, product name, and serial number) are also applicable to
      software components. For software revisions and patch revisions, the base inventory
      (Section 4 of {{!I-D.ietf-ivy-network-inventory-yang}})
      defines the "list" of "software-rev" and the "list" of
      "patch". For example, on a router, software components may
      include a routing protocol package
      (e.g., " foo-rt-protocol-suite"), or a firmware module for a
      line card (e.g., " foo-lc-fw-21.5.3").

If more detailed installation and activation
      information is needed, such as whether a component is active, pending-reboot,
 or rollback-eligible, along with its install time or activation
 time stamp, the extension attributes of software components
      can be used.

# Operational Considerations

   This section complements the operational considerations of the
   base network inventory model {{!I-D.ietf-ivy-network-inventory-yang}}.
   The considerations of {{!I-D.ietf-ivy-network-inventory-yang}}
   also apply to this extension: the read-only perspective of
   inventory data, data discovery by the server from underlying
   elements, aggregation at hierarchical controller interfaces,
   and brownfield migration scenarios.

   This model provides read-only reporting of software status and
   associated timestamps.  It reflects the state of software
   revisions and patches as discovered by the server; it does not
   track software configuration intent or repository state.

   The software inventory data is discovered by the server from
   underlying managed entities using implementation-specific
   mechanisms.  The installation-time and activation-time
   timestamps, as well as the software status (installed or
   activated), are reported as discovered from the managed entity.

   Software lifecycle management operations (install,
   activate, remove, etc.) are out of scope and SHOULD be defined
   in separate YANG modules.

# Security Considerations

This section is modeled after the template described in {{Section 3.7
of ?RFC9907}}.

The "ietf-network-inventory-sw-ext" YANG module augments the base
   network inventory model defined in {{!I-D.ietf-ivy-network-inventory-yang}}.
   All security considerations specified in the base model apply to this
   extension module. This section complements the base model with
   additional security considerations specific to software inventory
   extensions.

The "ietf-network-inventory-sw-ext" YANG module defines a data model that is
designed to be accessed via YANG-based management protocols, such as
NETCONF {{?RFC6241}} and RESTCONF {{?RFC8040}}. These YANG-based management
protocols (1) have to use a secure transport layer (e.g., SSH {{?RFC4252}}, TLS {{?RFC8446}},
and QUIC {{?RFC9000}}) and (2) have to use mutual authentication.

The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) {{!RFC8341}}
provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
notification) to these data nodes.

Specifically, the following subtrees and data nodes have particular sensitivities/vulnerabilities:

- "/nwi:network-elements/network-element/software-rev"
- "/nwi:network-elements/network-element/software-rev/patch"
- "/nwi:network-elements/network-element/components/component/software-rev"
- "/nwi:network-elements/network-element/component/component/software-rev/patch"
> These extension add status, installation time, and activation time
  to both NE-level and component-level software revisions and patches.
  Disclosure of detailed software versions, patch levels, and
  lifecycle timestamps can reveal unpatched vulnerabilities and
  operational maintenance windows, enabling targeted attacks.

# Examples of Software Attributes

This appendix illustrates, by means of two typical scenarios, how to
 populate the software-specific nodes defined in
 ietf-network-inventory-sw-ext and explains the common values that can be used.

Scenario 1: Whole-device base software (example-os) plus hot patches
 (P3 already activated, P4 installed but not yet activated).

Scenario 2: Line-card programmable forwarding image
 (example-fpga-image) plus its patch
 (2.1.0.P1 installed and awaiting activation).
